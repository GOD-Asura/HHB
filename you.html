    Let me tell you about the light that shone in the darkness and found it's way to me.
    She was a very dim light at first not much 
    visible on the eyes I must say. The light always remained
    silent and unnoticed. Althought the light was very beautiful and warm
    I didn't know much about that light. She indeed was a light with
    her very own beauty. One day She started shining bright, bright
    enough to remain on my mind. Bright enough to make me wonder. Bright enough to 
    make me crave her warmth. As I was always in the darkness I didn't know what to 
    do with the light approaching me. I didn't know how to react to the light, I didn't know at that time that one day that light is 
    going to be the only light that I would crave for at every moment. The light started
    to shine my world. She gave me warmth, she made me visible, I was filled with her warm love, I was mesmerized
    by her beauty. Now, that light shines the brightest,
    hugs me with her warmth. A very strong light I must say, she won't extinguish 
    even in stormy or rainy days, tries to shine even when darkness is about to 
    swallow her. Although the light is able to shine through everythig, am afraid.. am afraid that one day the light will 
    not be able to shine one day, that she will lose her fire and extinguish. The light knows that she must rest sometimes but am afraid that she is 
    unable to find her place to rest. I don't want the light to forget that 
    the world she once lit up is always welcoming her to take a rest.
    That world is always there for her in her hard times. There she can rest for as long as she can.
    There she can lay down all her burdens, all her complains, all her wishes. The world may not be able 
    to fulfill all her wishes but it definitly can do something about her lonliness.
    The light is sweet, sweet enough to bring happiness and put a smile on the face.
    She is captivating so captivating that the world she lit up only welcomes
    her. She is so mesmerizing that I never want to take my eyes off off her.
    You the light I once let go off returned back to me now I never want to loose you again.
    I don't even want to imagine a day without you. I want you to shine forever for me.
    As I will aslo light this world of mine only for you. You are the only warmth I want and will ever want.
    So for the light which once shone in my life. I shall forever be her strength
    , her home, her peace, her love...
    <br><br>
    Thank you for shining in my life
